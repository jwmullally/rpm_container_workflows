Linux container/VM images are root file systems.

Distributions such as https://debian.org and https://redhat.com have built filesystems from 10,000s of packages for 20+ years using software packaged in DEB and RPM format.

This repository is a demonstration of techniques for building container filesystem images using RPMs.
