If Jenkins build jobs get stuck on this:
    Still waiting to schedule task
    Jenkins doesnâ€™t have label rpmbuilder
 
- Try restart Jenkins (scale to 0 then 1)
- Check the logs to make sure this is showing:
    INFO: Adding PodTemplate: jenkins-slave-rpmbuilder-centos7
    ...
    INFO: Started provisioning Kubernetes Pod Template from openshift with 1 executors. Remaining excess workload: 0
    INFO: Created Pod: jenkins-slave-rpmbuilder-centos7-1b65dd09dc5

- Check jenkins-slave-rpmbuilder-centos7 image has finished building
- Cancel + restart the Jenkins build
